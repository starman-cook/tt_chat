**Important**

In some cases tests may through an Error of PATH for chrome, in that case add PATH in settings, path must be of the folder that is located inside test folder, called chromedriver_win32 (for non windows users, google it)

In case of version conflicts of chrome, use this link to download your version and then just replace the file in chromedriver_win32 folder

Good luck!
